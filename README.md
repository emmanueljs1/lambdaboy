# lambdaboy

An emulator for the Gameboy written in Haskell. A specific goal of this project is to write the emulator in such a way that malformed instructions are especially hard to create (i.e. to reduce the amount of unreachable code in that can lead to bugs and confusion).

- [x] Datatypes
- [x] Running an instruction end to end (CPU only)
- [ ] Executing an entire program (CPU only)
- [ ] GPU
- [ ] Interrupts
- [ ] Different cartridge types
